- Dynamic Routing and Donation Details Page : 

Description: Create dynamic routes for individual donation details. When a user clicks on a card, they are redirected to a dedicated page displaying all the donation information, including a picture, title, description, and a "Donate" button with a matching background color to the card.



-  Functional search bar : 

The website should have a functional search bar that allows users to search for donations by category, title, or other keywords. This will make it easy for users to find the donations they are interested in.
- Interactive Navigation Bar

Description: Implement a navigation bar that remains visible on all pages. The navbar includes a logo on the left and menu items (Home, Donation, Statistics) on the right. Apply an "active" state to the current route, providing visual feedback to users about their current location within the website.
